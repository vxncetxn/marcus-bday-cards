Hi Marcus, happy birthday!!

You’re such a bright spirit that adds so much joy everywhere you go! Always love your heart for people - in everywhere we go, everything we talk about, you’ll always add a “I think this person would love this”. You’re always thinking about how to love and connect which speaks so much of your heart for others! Also wna take this opportunity to thank you for always capturing and archiving all the memories we make as a cg through your photos, we’re very loved by you!!

Hav a great birthday!

- Dex
