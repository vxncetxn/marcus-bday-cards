HAPPIE BURDAE MARCUS!!

It’s really amazing how much we have grown together. 🌳

You are always a ball of sunshine, please never let that change! I still remember one random service WAY BACK you had just came back from thrift shopping and passed me a yellow shirt 👕 and told me you thought I’d like it so you got it for me!

Back then I wasn’t close to many people in church yet and we hadn’t talked many times but you still had such a big heart to think of me and get me something. ❤️‍🔥

You always reach out in incredible ways and with such incredible tenacity. You really try your best to reach every lost sheep you come across, and your heart will always inspire me to be a better friend and brother to those around me.🔥

Marcus, thanks for being a brother, a good friend who listens to me, and for your infectious fire for God✝️

P.s. let’s go to the arcade and play the drums game again soon, so rare to get to see something you aren’t instantly good at HAHAHAHHAHAHA

From: your brother that’s at the same altitude as you 🤪
