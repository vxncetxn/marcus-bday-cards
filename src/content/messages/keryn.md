Happy birthday Marcus!! Thank you for always bringing so much life and energy into the CG! You always have the best creativity for all the ideas and activities that we could do as a CG. Despite already having graduated, your heart for UR is still so strong! Always gonna have UR Revivals. Thanks for helping to capture the best moments happening in the CG too!! :))
