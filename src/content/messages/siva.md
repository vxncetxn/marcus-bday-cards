Hey Marcus! Happy birthday mahh dude! Absolutely love your heart and the energy you bring to the CG, oh. my. lord! Have spent certain occasions having conversations that are very very memorable and impactful in my life, and it will be an understatement to say that I cherish them.

I truly believe God has placed you in all of your friendsâ€™ lives for you to bring joy. Praying that your big dreams will slowly come to pass! Happy birthday once again Marcus! Have a blast buddy!
