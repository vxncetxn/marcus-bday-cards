Happy birthday marcus!
You are a fellow dinosaur in terms of how long you've been in church! I've been really glad to see you be more comfortable and finding your place. You remember the little things and are always willing to go the extra mile for people! You are a blessing of a friend as we go through our ups and downs, so here's to many more birthdays!
