Marcus! Happy Birthday!

You are an enigma.

Limitless energy, bottomless stomach, infinite nonsense and an abundant love for others. Your being somehow wields multiple infinities yet remains functional without collapsing in on itself. Instead, you still find more to give to the next person. I don’t know how you do it, but I guess that’s living proof that one can really do all things through Christ.

Thank you for showing me that it is indeed possible to give your best in different spheres of life and not grow weary, it inspires me! I may not be blessed with the ability to wield multiple infinities, but I am inspired to expand capacities in these areas.

As the seasons turn, do not allow these infinities collapse into the infinity of work. As you have successfully done this while in uni, may that inform your posture for the season to come. It is indeed an exciting transition, and it is a privilege to go through it with you. To greater things (:

See you when you come around Br(oken)-tain!
