Happy birthday Marcus! Oh, how can one miss you — you are that bubbly and super-energetic one always zipping around and lifting the spirits of everyone around you, always sprinting that extra mile no matter how fatiguing in service of the CG and our friends, always being that positive beacon of light :) Thanks for all of that, and also for the awesome initiative of having a shared photo album for the CG — one day, we will all look back at these priceless memories and be reminded of all the seasons that we have been running alongside each other! I hope that on this very special day of yours, you too can enjoy the joy that you bring to others, so happy birthday and have an amazing day!
