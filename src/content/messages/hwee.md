happy birthday marcus!!
you add so much life & energy in the cg in your unique ways.. it’s hard to imagine u not being in the cg. appreciate all the things you’d do to help out, esp all the small details that sometimes go unnoticed.

your future in God is great!! and He never fails. right timing, right place, right people. excited for your upcoming next season.. let’s give God our best years no matter what :-) the big G deserves only the best!
