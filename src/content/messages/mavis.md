Happiest Birthday to the Happiest-Go-Lucky Boy in SD4!!! ðŸŽ‚

I really just want to take this opportunity to say THANK YOU for being such an awesome and sweet friendâ€”not just to me, but to ALL your tomodachis. I'm sure I've shared this with you before, but just to reiterate, I think you're one of the few friends who truly goes above and beyond to be there for their friends. ðŸ«¶ That really touched me a lot, but it also inspired me to be there for my friends, family, and basically everyone around me. I think you're someone the CG really looks to when it comes to serving others! Thank you for being you, basically! Haha ðŸ¤ª

Also, I really like how we've become closer over the past year, especially recently with our childish banters and bickerings. Haha! Just know that I really appreciate and value the friendship we have. ðŸ™‚ Wishing you all the best for the next chapter of your life... YA LIFE!!! I can't wait to see the breakthroughs you'll have!!! ðŸ’ª

- Love, Mavis
